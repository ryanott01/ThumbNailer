Very basic application, only requirement is PIL (pip install pillow)

Next you will need an 'output' and 'input' folder inside of the same directory as the script.

Then put any photos you would like to apply the effect to inside of input, run the script, then check the output folder




The goal is to resize photos to always fit without adding black bars, stretching the photo, or cutting off parts of the photo
